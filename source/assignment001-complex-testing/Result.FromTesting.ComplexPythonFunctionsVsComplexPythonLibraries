The difference between the self made and built-in functions are:
When we use the built-in functions, we do not know what the function does in the background, if there is a problem, its hard to debug and fix. The built in functions are easier and when they work correctly, they lead to the correct result, speeding up the development process.

When we use self-made functions, they are easier to debug as we have made them by ourselves, but they are harder to make, they take a long time and in general are slower at the start.
